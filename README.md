# web-scraping-challenge
 Web App 1 & Web App 2 png files are screenshots of my web app.
 scrape_mars.py is the python script that runs on the web page to perform the scraping as well as input the scraped data onto the site.
 The Static folder contains the css styles for the page & the templates folder contains the web page that is rendered.
